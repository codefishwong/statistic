Population&Sample:
Population mean: sum(X)/N
Sample mean:sum(X)/n
Population variance:sum(x(I)-mean)^2/N
Sample variance:sum(x(I)-mean)^2/(n-1)(sample generally has smaller size and var is smaller, divided by n-1 make it get bigger)
var=E(x^2)-E(x)^2
Variable:
Continuous&Discrete, for continuous only interval probably is available, any specific point p is 0.
Binomial Distribution:
C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
E(x)=np
Law of large numbers:
the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.
Normal Distribution:
{\displaystyle \varphi (x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}}}
Z-score:z = (x – μ) / σ
